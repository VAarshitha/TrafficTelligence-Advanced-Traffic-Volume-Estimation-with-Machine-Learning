# Problem Statement

Urban traffic congestion continues to be a major problem in metropolitan cities, leading to increased pollution, delays, and fuel consumption. Traditional traffic estimation methods are often inaccurate or outdated. Our project, **TrafficTelligence**, aims to leverage machine learning algorithms to provide real-time and predictive traffic volume estimations using data collected from sensors, GPS, and historical records. This system is designed to help improve traffic management efficiency, reduce congestion, and support smart city planning initiatives.
